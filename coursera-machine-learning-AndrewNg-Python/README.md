# Material I made during the Machine Learning course by Andre Ng course from Coursera-Stanford

This contains notes and exercises made in Python I made a long time ago from the Andrew Ng course in Coursera.
The Course and material provided is made in Octave or R. When I made the course I also made the scripts in Python,
here I share those notebooks plus the notes I took. I have found these notes very helpful in more than one 
ocassion, perhaps they help you too. My handwriting is pretty bad sorry! I will clean them up soon. 

I hope nothing is broken as I haven't touch these files in a while.
